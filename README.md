# Exploits and stuff

This is a small collection of random explots, scripts and instructions also i don't condone you using these for illegal or bad stuff.

## dear admins

these computers are a poor excuse for a computer or in ur words "a helpful learning tool, oh golly look at all that joy, lets also make sure that we spend that 3 billion dollars on unblockers." and you go along and block everything to the point that websites that premote learning are blocked, you could of at least used some of tht 3 billion to bolt down the soap contaiers in the bathroom. just wait untill every thing is blocked and nothing! Nothing! will work anymore and the compliants will start flooding through just you wait. theres all ways a way, any time you block something more loop holes pop up.
